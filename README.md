##  RELDEC matlab implementation 

### Folders 
 - LDPC_Matlab 
    contains all matlab implementations of decoders and other utils required 
 - LDPC_Cpp 
    contains cpp implementation of layered and flooding decoders for WLAN LDPC

### To run reldec: 
-   We need a dataset of LLRs and correspoding codewords from which these LLRs are generated. This `LC_dataset.mat` can be found in LDPC_Matlab/Datasets/ . It can be generated by: 
    1. run `setup` from ./LDPC_Matlab 
    2. cd Extra 
    3. run `LC_generate` after changing required params in the same file

-   We also need the clusters and the variable nodes belongignto the cluster, and this is generated into another mat file:  `LDPC_init.mat`. To generate this, we need to change parameters in `./cluster_create.py` file and run it (requirements: scipy, numpy, networkx, matlab.engine)

These 2 files are already part of ./LDPC_Matlab/Datasets/ so there is no need to generate these unless you require some parameter changes (cluster size, LLR dataset size, etc).


You can  then  run `RELDEC` from the main directory. This will generate the Q table after training. 

### To run matlab decoders 
You can navigate to ./LDPC_Matlab and check for files 

- ldpc_layered.m
- ldpc_reldecode.m (calls RELDEC inside to generate Q table)
- ldpc_flooding.m 

These files contain all the required parameters to run an FER simulation for a given range of SNRs.
